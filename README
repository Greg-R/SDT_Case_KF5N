This is an alternative set of Freecad files for the T41 Software Designed Transceiver Project which were modified by Greg KF5N.

It is strongly recommended to view the files in Freecad before beginning a print.  There is a large variation in how
T41 transceivers are constructed.  Each builder has their own ideas on how to assemble the radio.

So these files are meant as a "starting point" for your own custom design.  What you see is what you get, so please
feel free to make changes to accommodate your own preferences for your version of the T41 radio.
